# Test Private Click Measurement (PCM)

PCM is the new way to track attribution to [offsite conversion events in Webkit](https://webkit.org/blog/11529/introducing-private-click-measurement-pcm/).

This is a small test project that tries to interate the PCM into an iOS App which can track offsite conversion in either the Safari App or SFSafariViewController (SVC).
